# RecommenderSystem
The main motive of this work is to build a recommender system for articles read online in a website. 
There are many methods in the modern machine learning era which could be deployed to make models for this recommendation system. 

# DataSet Info
The dataset used here was taken from DeskDrop, an Internal Communications Platform developed by CI & T. 
The dataset is split into two parts namely Shared Articles and User Interactions and combined to build the model. 

# Techniques Used
Collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques have been used. 
The algorithms used in this recommender system are Bayesian Personalized Ranking(BPR), Alternating Least Squares(ALS) and Logistics Matrix Factorization(LMF). 
The performance of these algorithms shows a high true positive rate and a better accuracy in terms of recommendation as compared to basic Collaborative Filtering Algorithms.
